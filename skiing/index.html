	  <h1>The Story:</h1>
	  <h3>When I was around 7 or 8 years old, my dad took me to the slopes to share his passion for skiing. 
		  He loved skiing and thought passing that on to me would be cool. At first, I found skiing difficult. 
		  I kept falling over and struggled to get the hang of it. My dad was patient, always encouraging me to keep trying, even when I was frustrated. 
		  Over time, things started to get easier, and I began to gain more confidence on the slopes. 
		  It wasn’t long before I started enjoying it, despite the initial challenges. 
		  Those early experiences with my dad on the mountain are some of my fondest memories</h3>
	  
	  <h3>After that, I started going up to the slopes with my dad multiple times a week, and I really started to enjoy it. 
		  It became something I looked forward to, and the more I skied, the more I loved it. 
		  Soon enough, my brothers started tagging along, and it turned into a fun family activity. 
		  We spent weekends together on the mountain, and I was getting pretty good at it. 
		  But just as I was getting really into skiing, I broke my foot and had to sit out for the rest of the season. 
		  It was frustrating because I felt like I was finally getting the hang of it. 
		  Now, I’ll just have to wait until next year before I can get back on the slopes. 
		  Hopefully, when I return, I’ll be ready to pick up where I left off and ski even better.</h3>
